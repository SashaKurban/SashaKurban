### ‚≠ê About Me

üë©‚Äçüíª I am an aspiring Software Engineer studying Computer Science at Brooklyn College, set to graduate in May 2023. I am also a President of the Computer Science club, working in a team to mentor students and host valuable tech-workshops to improve their skills. 

üí° During my recent summer internship at Capital One I gained experience working with React, Next.js, JavaScript, HMTL/CSS and Jest. I am interested in further learning Software and Full-Stack development.

üî≠ Currently I am working on a Full-Stack personal project ‚ÄúExpiration Date‚Äù, which allows users to track expiration dates of their groceries and to reorganize them in various ways. I have used Spring Boot and PostgeSQL for the backend of the application, and React for the frontend.
Check out my [project] (https://expiration-date.vercel.app/?)

‚ù§Ô∏è I am passionate about learning new technologies, solving real-world problems and applying my skills to software projects.
